# Adapters
Instead of adding a ton of jumpers to the module with the aim of accounting for every system known to man, I instead chose to leave those details up to the adapter. For more specific information, see the [adapters](https://github.com/tebl/C64-JoyKEY/blob/main/documentation/adapters.md) document available as part of the documentation (mostly to avoid having to maintain two copies of the same information).

For BOM, parts needed on putting it together is found in the relevant subfolder READMEs.
