# Faceplates
The *C64 JoyKEY* will have a selection of faceplates, these are primarily just here to make the device a bit prettier by hiding the actual electronics. Secondly it adds some rigidity to the design, quite possibly making it less likely to fail after heavy use.

These generally come in two different variations, A and B with a number added to separate the various designs. The A version has a larger PCB cutout that should allow you to use most of Cherry MX-compatible keycaps of the kind that descends down past the actual switch, if you're in doubt this is the version to get. The B designs have a smaller cutout, but requires the use of keycaps that don't descend so far down.

See the [faceplates](https://github.com/tebl/C64-JoyKEY/blob/main/documentation/faceplates.md) section of documentation for more information.
